          <p>
            Space Biology is a field of science dedicated to understanding how spaceflight affects living organisms. Researchers study everything from single-celled bacteria to complex organisms like plants and humans to see how they adapt to the unique environment of space, which includes microgravity, radiation, and isolation.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-display text-space-light-blue mb-3">Why Does It Matter?</h2>
          <p>
            This research is crucial for two main reasons. First, it helps us protect the health of astronauts on long-duration missions to the Moon, Mars, and beyond. Understanding how bodies change in space allows us to develop effective countermeasures against negative health effects. Second, studying life in an extreme environment like space can reveal fundamental insights into biological processes that are applicable to life on Earth, leading to advancements in medicine and agriculture.
